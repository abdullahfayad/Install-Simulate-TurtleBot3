In order to install TurtleBot3 and to launch any of its files you should follow these steps:
1- You should create a ros workspace.
2- Inside this workspace and inside the src folder path you should type these commands:
  =>git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
  =>git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
  =>git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
3- Go back to the root of the workspace then type "catkin_make"
4- Type "source devel/setup.bash" then type "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger". The model can be burger,waffle or waffle_pi.
5- After that you should run roscore in other terminal.
6- To launch the TurtleBot type for example "roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch" 

*Note: If the Gazebo program close directly after launching, you should type this "export SVGA_VGPU10=0" before running the simulation.
